# Ancient Mining in Asia Data

This is a friends and family project to organize research data on mining in json. If the research is continued and expanded, this may become useful.

### Tools and Blueprints

Based on a [mozilla javascript learning resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON).

Originally, this was meant to live on a local machine only. However, using local files is a problem in javascript, see e.g. this [mozilla article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSRequestNotHttp) . Which is why we put the data and code on github.

The real data is much more. We only reorganized one Word Document of many, and that only partially. Without explanations, this is pretty useless. The idea is to evaluate if json organized data is helpful for this kind of research.
